# Gameplay Ability System RPG
  This project has been an incredible learning experience. All thanks to the hard work and prowess of Stephen Ulibarri, the instructor of the course.

 I can proudly say that my C++ skills especially, and UE skills as a whole, improved drastically over the **300+ hours** put into this project. I'm a firm believer that what you put in you get back out, whether it be a project, hobby, in school, or life in general, so **always give it your all!** I went above and beyond as much as I could refactoring and improving code, creating content and new features, and even a new modular mechanic (Champion enemy types)! I'm happy with the addition of this extra mechanic, it adds some more variety and fun to each encounter.

## Features
- OOP with inheritance and polymorphism for a flexible, extensible class heirarchy
  
- [SOLID](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) coding principles and code architecture for **clean and maintainable code** that you would see in **AAA** game production
  
- Extensive use of Unreal Engine's **Gameplay Ability System**, including **abilities**, **effects**, **cues**, and **tags**. The GA system is extremely powerful, even currently used in **Epic Games**'s flagship title **Fortnite**. It's used here for many applications both in *C++* and *blueprints* for character attributes, spells, damage handling, debuffs, level up system, and more!
  
- Fully networked, meaning it could easily be set up for a multiplayer game (although out of scope for this project). Only what's necessary for each client to receive (Gameplay Cues, Effects) is replicated over the network for efficient bandwidth use and no lag or desync issues
